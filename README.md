‘Taste of South East Asia’ is a website to showcase the recipes and history of South East Asia.



1.	Project Description
Our project is a website that shows traditional, national dishes from each country of the South East Asian region, or more specifically, the countries that are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). For each of these dishes, there will be a recipe page as well as a page that goes into what the dish is, and the history behind said dish. People can register an account in our website.
